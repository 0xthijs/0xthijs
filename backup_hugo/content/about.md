# People Logic meets Machine Logic

I am a **Senior HRBP turning AI-Enabler**, passionate about bridging the gap between human resources and artificial intelligence. My journey is defined by a unique blend of strategic HR expertise and a growing proficiency in AI technologies.

In my work, I strive to combine the intuitive, empathetic understanding of organizational dynamics—**people logic**—with the precise, data-driven capabilities of modern algorithms—**machine logic**. I believe that the future of work lies in the harmonious integration of these two forces.

This portfolio showcases my projects and explorations in HR analytics, where I apply data science and AI to solve real-world people challenges.
